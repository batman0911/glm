```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Linear regression models

```{r}
library(GLMsData); data("lungcap")

lungcap$Smoke <- factor(lungcap$Smoke, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Non-smoker", "Smoker"))
LC.lm <- lm(FEV ~ Ht + Gender + Smoke, data = lungcap)
summary(LC.lm)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
